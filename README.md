# K-Nearest Neighbors Image Classifier

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for image recognition using datasets such as MNIST and Fashion MNIST. The KNN model is used to classify images by finding the K nearest neighbors based on Euclidean distances between image features.

## Features

	•	Read images and labels from the dataset files.
	•	Extract features from images by flattening the pixel values.
	•	Train and predict using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
	•	Compute Euclidean distances between images.
	•	Predict the label of test images by voting among the K nearest neighbors.
	•	Evaluate and display the accuracy of the model.

## Datasets

	•	MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits (0-9).
	•	Fashion MNIST: A dataset of fashion items such as T-shirts, trousers, coats, etc.
